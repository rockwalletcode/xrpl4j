 * Claim XRP from a payment channel, adjust the payment channel's expiration, or both. This transaction can be
 * used differently depending on the transaction sender's role in the specified channel:
 *
 * <p>The source address of a channel can:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Send XRP from the channel to the destination with or without a signed Claim.</li>
 *  <li>Set the channel to expire as soon as the channel's SettleDelay has passed.</li>
 *  <li>Clear a pending Expiration time.</li>
 *  <li>Close a channel immediately, with or without processing a claim first. The source address cannot
 *   close the channel immediately if the channel has XRP remaining.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The destination address of a channel can:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Receive XRP from the channel using a signed Claim.</li>
 *  <li>
 *    Close the channel immediately after processing a Claim, refunding any unclaimed XRP to the channel's source.
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Any address sending this transaction can:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Cause a channel to be closed if its Expiration or CancelAfter time is older than the previous ledger's
 *  close time. Any validly-formed PaymentChannelClaim transaction has this effect regardless of the contents
 *  of the transaction.</li>

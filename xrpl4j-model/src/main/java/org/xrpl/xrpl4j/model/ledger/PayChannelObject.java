/**
 * The PayChannel object type represents a payment channel. Payment channels enable small, rapid off-ledger payments of
 * XRP that can be later reconciled with the consensus ledger. A payment channel holds a balance of XRP that can only
 * be paid out to a specific destination address until the channel is closed. Any unspent XRP is returned to the
 * channel's owner (the source address that created and funded it) when the channel closes.
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.PaymentChannelCreate} transaction type creates a PayChannel object.
 * The {@link org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.PaymentChannelFund} and
 * {@link org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.PaymentChannelClaim} transaction types modify existing PayChannel objects.
 *
 * <p>When a payment channel expires, at first it remains on the ledger, because only new transactions can modify
 * ledger contents. Transaction processing automatically closes a payment channel when any transaction accesses it
 * after the expiration. To close an expired channel and return the unspent XRP to the owner, some address must send
 * a new {@link org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.PaymentChannelClaim} or
 * {@link org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.PaymentChannelFund} transaction accessing the channel.
